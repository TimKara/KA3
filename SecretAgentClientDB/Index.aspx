                <b>Classified information is sensitive information to which access is restricted by 
                law or regulation to particular groups of persons. A formal security clearance 
                is required to handle classified documents or access classified data. The 
                clearance process requires a satisfactory background investigation. There are 
                typically several levels (classes) of sensitivity, with differing clearance 
                requirements. This sort of hierarchical system of secrecy is used by virtually 
                every national government. The act of assigning the level of sensitivity to data 
                is called data classification.</b>
